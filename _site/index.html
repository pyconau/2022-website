<p>We will not be running PyCon AU in 2022. We’ll see you, in person, in 2023.</p>

<hr />

<p>Just as the PyCon AU 2022 team were getting seriously underway, the Omicron wave struck Australia. At that time, we didn’t know how long or how severe the wave would be; and, we won’t know how Australia will cope with other waves that will eventually follow.</p>

<p>The process of making a PyCon AU happen starts many, many months ahead. It’s hard for us to offer an appealing Call for Proposals or Call for Sponsors, to be confident that we’re spending the community’s money wisely, or for our volunteer organising team to be enthusiastic about the many, many hours of hard work they’re putting in, with so much uncertainty about what sort of event we could even run, if any.</p>

<p>We’re actively prioritising a sustainable planning cycle entering 2023 over the risk of burning out our small pool of new and existing conference organisers.  We want the team and community to be refreshed and ready to make the next in person PyCon AU as good as it can be. For those reasons, our online (PyConline) will not be returning for 2022.</p>

<p>As we aren’t holding a national gathering this year, we want to take the time to highlight all the wonderful local Python user groups around the country and nearby. As local restrictions allow, these meetups will be run with their own local organising teams. See below for a list of events (and <a href="https://github.com/pyconau/2022-website/issues/new">let us know</a> if we’ve missed any!).</p>

<p>You can also check <a href="https://pycon.org/">pycon.org</a> for a calendar of Python events and meetups.</p>

<p><strong>We hope to see you all again, in person, in Adelaide in August 2023</strong>. We’d also like to thank the <a href="https://www.avmc.com.au/">Adelaide Venue Management Corporation</a> for their flexibility and understanding in working with us from the very start of the pandemic in 2020.</p>

<p>Look for our announcements on our dates and call for proposals on our Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/pyconau">@pyconau</a>, and subscribe to our <a href="http://lists.linux.org.au/mailman/listinfo/pycon-au-announce">low-volume announcement mailing list</a> for updates.</p>
